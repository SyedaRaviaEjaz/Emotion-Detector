# Emotion-Detector
This is an image classifier that will distinguish between different emotions and expressions.

This idea is implemented using the Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) which accurately detect facial emotions using facial expressions. The 
project uses a combination of artificial intelligence techniques and deep learning algorithms to identify the emotions expressed by a person's face. 

The dataset from Kaggle consists of thousands of examples of 48x48 pixel gray scale images of faces used for training and testing the system consists of thousands of images of human faces with varying emotions; Images in the dataset are categorized into either happiness, neutral, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust or fear, based on the emotion shown in the facial expression.

The results of the project show that the system can accurately detect facial emotions with high precision and recall rates, indicating its potential for use in various applications, such as emotion-based marketing, mental health diagnosis, and human-robot interaction
